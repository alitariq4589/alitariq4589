Hi, I am Ali Tariq. I am an electrical Engineer, Embedded C Programmer and Verilog HDL processor and hardware designer.
I am quite fond of exploring new microprocessors and microcontrollers in industry. I have worked and explored Texas instruments microcontrollers, Arduino AVR
microcontrollers, and STM32 microcontrollers. In hardware programming, I have worked on Nexys Artix-7 FPGA (Field programmable Gate Array) on verilog language.
I am currently on a long journey to become a top-notch in Embedded programming (which is also refered to as automation) and processor/Chip development.
One can always reach me regarding projects related to Verilog HDL, Embedded C programming and their respective IDEs.
